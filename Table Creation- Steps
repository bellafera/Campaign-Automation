NOTES:

Objective: Use Python code to automate the generation of the ongoing campaign reports.

STEPS:
1)	At the Anaconda prompt type: python
2)	Paste “Automation_Campaign_Python_script” and press enter. Make sure to change the campaign name every time you run the code for a different campaign.
3)	The Python script:  
•	Connects to Hive through the ODBC driver
•	Uses SQL to query the tables on Hive
•	Manipulates the data and calculates all the metrics for the campaign report
•	Converts the metrics into string and put them in a report layout using ReportLab module
•	Saves the report as .pdf in created folder with the campaign name and date the campaign was launched
2) To automate the running of the script you can use Crontab. Please follow the steps here: https://opensource.com/article/17/11/how-use-cron-linux. Please change the path where the Python script is located.
